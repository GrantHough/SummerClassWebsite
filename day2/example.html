    Today, we began covering JavaScript basics. Below is an example code segment that synthesizes the main topics we covered today. It combines variables, conditional statements, and functions to create a program centered around gamifying walking. Inspect element and check the console to see what this code results in.
    <pre>

        //variable for total # of miles walked
        let totalMilesWalked = 0;
        
        //variable for total user points
        let totalPoints = 0;

        //defining the function to input a walk
        //takes in miles walked and how many hills the walk had
        function walk(miles, hills) {
            //adds miles walked to total
            let walkPoints = 0;
            totalMilesWalked = totalMilesWalked + miles;

            //if there were hills on the walk 
            if (hills > 10) {
                walkPoints = totalPoints + 50 + 100 * miles;
                totalPoints = walkPoints + totalPoints;
            } else if (hills > 5) {
                walkPoints = totalPoints + 25 + 75 * miles;
                totalPoints = walkPoints + totalPoints;
            } else {
                walkPoints = totalPoints + 50 * miles;
                totalPoints = walkPoints + totalPoints;
                
            }

            return walkPoints;
        }

        console.log(totalPoints);
        walk(3, 2);
        console.log(totalPoints);
        console.log(walk(4, 11));
        console.log(totalPoints);
        console.log(walk(5, 6));
        console.log(totalPoints);
